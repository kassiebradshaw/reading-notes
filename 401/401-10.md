# Class 10 - Stacks and Queues

## [Stacks](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html#what-is-a-stack)

A Stack is a data structure that consists of `Nodes`.

* Each `Node` references the next node in the stack, but doesn't reference its previous.

---

**Stack Common Terminology**:

|  | Term | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Push | Nodes or items that are put into the stack are *pushed* |
| 2 | Pop | Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are *popped* - When you attempt to `pop` an empty stack an exception will be raised  |
| 3 | Top | This is the top of the stack |
| 4 | Peek | When you `peek` you will view the value of the `top` Node in the stack. - When you attempt to `peek` an empty stack an exception will be raised. |
| 5 | isEmpty | Returns *true* when stack is empty, otherwise returns *false* |

---

**Stacks follow these concepts**:

| | | |
|-|-|-|
| FILO | **F**irst **I**n **L**ast **O**ut | First item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack |
| LIFO | **L**ast **I**n **F**irst **O**ut | Last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack |

* When you push something into a stack, it becomes the new `top`
* When you pop something from the stack, you pop the current `top` and set the next top as `top.next`

### Push / Pop / Peek / isEmpty

**Push**:

* Pushing a node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. It takes the same amount of time regardless of the number of nodes in the stack.

* You push it onto the stack by assigning it as the new top, with its `next` property equal to the original (current) `top`
  * Pseudocode:

  ```Python
  ALOGORITHM push(value)
  // INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
  // OUTPUT <-- none
     node = new Node(value)
     node.next <-- Top
     top <-- Node
  ```

**Pop**:

* Top will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below the Node being removed, and the `top` Node is returned to the user.
* Typically you would check `isEmpty` before trying a `pop` to ensure an exception is not raised. Or wrap it in a try/catch block.
* Make sure to clear the `.next` of your temp variable!
  * Pseudocode:

  ```Python
  ALGORITHM pop()
  // INPUT <-- No input
  // OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
  // EXCEPTION if stack is empty

    Node temp <-- top
    top <-- top.next
    temp.next <-- null
    return temp.value
  ```

**Peek**:

* You're only inspecting the `top` Node of the stack
* First check `isEmpty` or wrap in a try/catch block
  * Pseudocode:
  
  ```Python
  ALGORITHM peek()
  // INPUT <-- none
  // OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
  // EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   return top.value
   ```

**isEmpty**:

* Checks if the stack is empty
  * Pseudocode:

  ```Python
  ALGORITHM isEmpty()
  // INPUT <-- none
  // OUTPUT <-- boolean

  return top = NULL
  ```

## [Queues](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html#what-is-a-queue)

**Queue Common Terminology**:

|  | Term | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Enqueue | Nodes or items that are added to the queue |
| 2 | Dequeue | Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. - If called when queue is empty, an exception will be raised. |
| 3 | Front | This is the front/first Node of the queue |
| 4 | Rear | This is the rear/last Node of the queue |
| 5 | End | When you `peek` you will view the value of the `front` Node in the queue. - If called when the queue is empty, an exception will be raised. |
| 6 | isEmpty | returns *true* when queue is empty, otherwise returns *false* |

---

**Queues follow these concepts**:

| | | |
|-|-|-|
| FIFO | **F**irst **I**n **F**irst **O**ut | First item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue |
| LILO | **L**ast **I**n **L**ast **O**ut | Last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue |

### Enqueue / Dequeue / Peek / isEmpty

**Enqueue**:

* Pseudocode:

  ```Python
  ALGORITHM enqueue(value)
  // INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
  // OUTPUT <-- none
     node = new Node(value)
     rear.next <-- node
     rear <-- node
  ```

**Dequeue**:

* Pseudocode:

  ```Python
  ALGORITHM dequeue()
  // INPUT <-- none
  // OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node
  // EXCEPTION if queue is empty

     Node temp <-- front
     front <-- front.next
     temp.next <-- null

     return temp.value  
  ```

**Peek**:

* Pseudocode:

  ```Python
  ALGORITHM peek()
  // INPUT <-- none
  // OUTPUT <-- value of the front Node in Queue
  // EXCEPTION if Queue is empty

     return front.value
  ```

**isEmpty**:

* Pseudocode:

  ```Python
  ALGORITHM isEmpty()
  // INPUT <-- none
  // OUTPUT <-- boolean

  return front = NULL
  ```
