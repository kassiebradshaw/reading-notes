# Class 11 - Data Analysis

[What is Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)

* JupyterLab is a web-based user interfae for Project Jupyter
  * Allows you to work with documents and activities suc as Jupyter notebooks.
* Understands many file formats such as images, CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, etc

* Jupyter Notebooks has 2 modes: Command & Edit
  * Keyboard Shortcuts:
    * Add a cell above (a)
    * Add a cell below (b)
    * Copy a cell (c)
    * Paste a cell (v)
    * Cut a cell (x)
    * Delete a cell (dd)
    * Undo (z)
    * Redo (shift+z)
    * Change cell format to Code (y)
    * Change cell format to Markdown (m)
    * Edit currently active cell (enter)
    * Run cell (shift+enter)
    * [In command mode] Restart kernel (00)

[Numpy Tutorial](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)

NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package.

* Almost every data analysis or machine learning package for Python leverages NumPy in sum way.

(SSV - semicolon separated values)

With NumPy we work with multidimensional arrays. In a NumPy array:

* The number of dimensions is called the rank
* Each dimension is called on an axis.
* (In the example the rows are the first axis, and the columns are the second axis)

[Numpy Arrays](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/numpy/index.htm)

* NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
* NumPy is a library
  * Consists of multidemnsional array objects
  * Collection of routines for processing those arrays

* Used to perform mathematical and logical operations
