# Class 02 - Testing & Modules

## [In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932)

### **TDD**

* TDD stands for Test-Driven Development
  * It's a strategy to think and write tests first
* Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behavior of your code.

* Important aspects about the unit test
  * **The test name**
    * Can be considered as live documentation
    * Needs to be descriptive about what we are testing and what we are expecting
  * **The test file name**
    * Should follow the same name of module name.
    * Example: if module `is gender.py` test file name should be `test_gender.py`
  * **Structure**
    * Widely used convention is AAA: *Arrange, Act, Assert*
      * Arrange: Organize data needed to execute that piece of code (input)
      * Act: execute the code being tested (exercise the behavior)
      * Assert: after executing the code, check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting

### **The Cycle**

* The cycle is an important aspect of TDD, made of three steps:
  * Write a test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn't there yet)
  * Write the feature and make the test pass
  * Refactor the code - the first version doesn't need to be perfect

### **What is Recursion?**

* Recursion is the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.

### **What is base condition in recursion?**

* The solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems

### **Advantages & Disadvantages of recursive programming** 

* Advantage over iterative programming: provides a clean and simple way to write code. Some problems are inherently recursive

* Disadvantage over iterative programming: recursive programming has greater space requirements than iterative programming, as all functions will remain in the stack until the base case is reached. It also has greater time requirements because of function calls and returns overhead.

* This video really helped me visualize everything else I've learned about recursion so far, especially when it comes to "the stack" concept.
