## [Pain and Suffering](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering)

* "All growth comes with some degree of pain, as it pulls you out of your comfort zone."

* "Find the common thread that makes the pain worthwile, that puts the pain into perspective."

## [Beginners Guide to Big O](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/)

### **Big O notation**

* Used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm - specifically worst-case scenario.

  * O(1) - will always execute in the same time/space regardless of the size of the input data set.

  * O(N) - performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

  * O(N^2) - performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
    * Common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in o(N^3), O(N^4), etc.

  * O(2^N) - growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.
    * The growth curve of this type of function is exponential. An example is the recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers.

### **Logarithms**

* O(log N) - iterative halving of data sets

  * Produces a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase.
