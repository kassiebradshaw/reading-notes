## [Dunder Methods](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods)

Predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes

* **Treat these methods like a normal language feature**

* Also known as "magic methods" or "special methods" - methods starting with double underscores such as  `__init__` or `__str__`

* Dunder methods emulate the behavior of built-in methods

* The `__init__` is like a constructor function that allows you to create objects from the class.

**Object Representation**:

* `__repr__` : The "official" representation of an object, unambiguous
* `__str__` : The "informal" or nicely printable string representation of an object.

Example:

```Python
class Account:
    """A simple account class"""

    def __init__(self, owner, amount=0):
        """
        This is the constructor that lets us create 
        objects from this class
        """
        self.owner = owner
        self.amount = amount
        self._transactions = []

    def __repr__(self):
      return 'Account({!r}, {!r})'.format(self.owner, self.amount)


    def __str__(self):
      return 'Account of {} with starting amount: {}'.format(self.owner, self.amount)
```

**Callable Python Objects**:

* You can make an object callable like a regular function by adding the `__call__` dunder method
  * In general, a downside of having a `__call__` method on your objects is that it can be hard to see what the purpose of calling the object is - be more specific and add an explicit method to the class.


## [Statistics - Probability](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/basic-statistics-in-python-probability/)

Probability seeks to answer the question - "What is the chance of an event happening?"

* The sample space - the set of all possible events that can happen
* To calculate the probability of an event happening: event divided by sample space (Flipping a coin is a 1-in-2 chance of landing on heads or tails)

Probability provides a theory, while statistics provides the tools to test that theory using data

* The normal distribution is significant to probability and statistics because of 2 factors:
  * **Central Limit Theorem**: with more trials, the closer the average of these trials approach the true probability, even if the individual trials themselves are imperfect
  * **Three Sigma Rule**: dictates that given a normal distribution, 68% of your observations will fall between one standard deviation of the mean. 95% will fall within two, and 99.7% will fall within three.
