## From the Duckett HTML & CSS Book

### Chapter 7: "Forms" (pg 144-175)

HTML Forms give you a set of elements to collect data from your users.

You should never change the name of a form control in a page unless you know the code on the server will understand this new value.

Form controls live inside a \<form> element. Should always carry an action attribute BUT will usually have a method and id attribute too.

### Chapter 14: "Lists, Tables & Forms" (pg 330-357)

Nobody likes filling in forms, so make yours look more attractive and easier to use and it's more likely people will fill them in.
