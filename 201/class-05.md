# Class 5 reading notes

## From the Duckett HTML & CSS Book

### Chapter 5: "Images" (pg 94-125)

* If you are building a website from scratch it's best to store all images in a specific folder for images
* Images are added using `<img>` tag, which is an empty element that needs no closing tag
  * `<img>` tags MUST include 2 attributes - src and alt
    * src - tells browser where it can find the image
    * alt - provides a text description, used for screen readers or if the image can't be displayed
    * title - can also be used to provide additional info about the image (displayed in a tooltip when user hovers over image)
* Images often take longer to load than HTML code

THREE RULES FOR CREATING IMAGES:

* Save images in the right format - jpg, gif, png
* Save images at the right size - create at same width/height it will be on website
* Measure images in pixels - as opposed to centimeters or inches

* Adobe Photoshop is most popular image editor tool

IMAGE FORMATS

* Use JPEG for images with many different colors
* Use GI or PNG format when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color (flat colors) - often logos, diagrams, illustrations

### Chapter 11: "Color" (pg 246-263)

SPECIFY COLOR IN CSS 3-4 WAYS:

* RGB values - red, green, blue values between 0-255
* Hex codes - six-digit codes preceded by #
* Color names - 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers
* HSLA

### Chapter 12: "Text" (pg 264-299)

TYPEFACE TERMINOLOGY

* serif - extra details on ends of main strokes of letters
* sans-serif - straight ends to letters, cleaner design
* monospace (fixed width) - all letters are same width

* Weight - adds emphasis and can also affect amount of white space and contrast on page
  * light, medium, bold, black
* Style - Italic fonts have a cursive aspect, oblique is normal style put at an angle
  * normal, italic, oblique
* Stretch - in condensed, letters are thinner and closer together. In extended they are thicker and further apart.
  * condensed, regular, extended

Designers suggest pages usually look better if they use no more than 3 typefaces on a page
