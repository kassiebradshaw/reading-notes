# Class 04 - React and Forms

## [React Docs - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

HTML form elements work differently from other DOM elements in React because form elements naturally keep some internal state.

**Controlled Components**

In HTML, form elements like ``<input>``, ``<textarea>``, and ``<select>`` maintain their own state and update based on user input.

Make the React state to be the "single source of truth" to have a React component render a from which also controls what happens in that form. This type of form element is called a "controlled component"

With a controlled component, the input's value is always driven by the React state. You can use this to pass the value of state to other elements too.

**Controlled Input Null Value**

Specifying the value prop on a controlled component prevents the user from changing the input unless you want them to be able to.

## [React Bootstrap - Forms](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/forms/)

The ``<FormControl>`` component renders a form control with Bootstrap styling. It wraps a form control with proper spacing, along with support for a label, help text and validation state.
