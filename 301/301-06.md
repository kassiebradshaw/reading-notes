> Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's v8 JavaScript engine and libuv library. --[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/node.js/info)

* The V8 engine is open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium based-web browsers.
  * Responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

* Node is an enhancement of the V8 engine with added features - file system API, HTTP library, operating system-related utility methods.
  * Node programs aren't executed in a browser. Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers, i.e. a JavaScript runtime.

Node and npm are used to install and run various build tools, designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

One of the biggest use cases for Node.js is running JavaScript on the server.

**Advantages of Node.js:**

* Speed
* Scalability
* You can do everything in the same language
  * (For example you can share code between the server and the client)
  * Speaks JSON - the most important data exchange format on the Web, the preferred language for interacting with object databases.

## [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

Four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language:

1. Listening
2. Speaking
3. Reading
4. Writing

Pair programming touches on all 4 skills. Developers:

* explain out loud what the code should do
* listen to others' guidance
* read code that others have written
* write code themselves

Pair programming promotes:

* Greater efficiency
* Engaged collaboration
* Learning from fellow students/peers
* Social skills
* Job interview readiness
* Work environment readiness

## [Axios Docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)

Axios is a Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js

* It can make `XMLHttpRequests` from the browser
* Can make `http` requests from node.js
* Supports the Promise API
* Intercepts request and response
* Transforms the request and response data
* Cancels requests
* Automatical transforms for JSON data

## [MDN async and await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await)

The async functions and await keywords are features that basically act as syntactic sugar on top of promises, making asynchronous code easier to write and to read afterwards.

They make async code look more like old-school synchronous code.

### ASYNC

* An async function is a function that knows how to expect the possibility of the  `await` keyword being used to invoke asynchronous code.

* The `async` keyword is added to functions to tell them to return a promise rather than directly returning the value.

* Put the `async` keyword in front of a function declaration to turn it into an async function.

### AWAIT

* The `await` keyword only works inside async functions within regular JavaScript code

* `await` can be put in front of any async promise-based function to pause your code on that line until the promise fulfills, then return the resulting value

* You can use `await` when calling any function that returns a Promise, including web API functions
