# Class 07 - REST

## [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers that sent documents across the internet. His name is on the specification for HTTP - the protocol used to get pages from servers to your browser.

* HTTP tells the browser what protocol to use. 

* The world wide web is built on an architectural style called "REST" - which provides a definition of a "resource"

* URL is machine equivalent of a noun

* Polymorphism - different nounds can have the same verb applied to them.

* You can't apply the same verb to every noun: drive a cup, drink a car

* HTTP is all about applying verbs to nouns.
  * When you go to a webpage the browser does an HTTP GET on the url you type in and retrieves a web page

* HTTP is not *just* to GET things
