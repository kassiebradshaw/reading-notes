# Class 12 - Mongo & Mongoose

## [NoSQL vs SQL](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)

* In the last several years NoSQL database is getting widely adopted to solve various business problems.

### SQL vs NoSQL: High Level Differences

| SQL | NoSQL |
| :-----------: | :------------: |
| Primarily called as relational Database (RDBMS)|Primarily called as **non**-relational or distributed database |
| Table-based database | Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
| Have predefined schema | Have dynamic schema for unstructured data |
| Vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable |
| Scaled by increasing horse-power of the hardware - CPU, RAM, SSD, etc on a single server| Scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load. Add more servers to handle large traffic |
| Uses SQL (structured query language) for defining and manipulating the data - very powerful | Queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language) |
| Examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres, MS-SQL | Examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassndra, Hbase, Neo4j, CouchDb |
| Good fit for complex query intensive environment | Not a good fit for complex queries - doesn't have standard interfaces to perform them, the queries are not as powerful |
| Not best fit for hierarchical data storage | Fits better for hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. Highly preferred for large database |
| Best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications, more stable and promises atomicity and integrity of data | Not comparable in high-load or for complex transactional applications |
| Excellent support available | Still have to rely on community support, limited outside experts are available |
| Emphasizes on ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) | Follows Brewers CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) |
| Can be classified as either open-source or close-sourced from commercial vendors | Can be classified on basis of way of storing data as graph databases, key-value store databases, document store databases, column store database and XML databases |

### MongoDB

* MongoDB is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database, it stores data in JSON like documents.

* Non-relational database with dynamic schema

* developed by the founders of DoubleClick, written in C++

* Currently being used by companies like The New York Times, Craigslist, MTV Networks

  Benefits & Strengths:
  * Speed: Gives good performance for simple queries - all the related data are in single document, which eliminates join operations
  * Scalability: Horizontally scalable meaning you can reduce the workload by increasing number of servers instead of relying on a stand-alone resource
  * Manageable: Easy to use for both developers and administrators. Gives the ability to shard the database
  * Dynamic Schema: Gives you the flexibility to evolve your data schema without modifying the existing data

## [NoSQL modeling techniques](https://highlyscalable.wordpress.com/2012/03/01/nosql-data-modeling-techniques/)

* NoSQL data modeling often starts from the application-specific queries ("What questions do I have?") as opposed to relational-modeling ("What answers do I have?")

* NoSQL often requires a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms

### Basic Principles of NoSQL Data Modeling

#### Conceptual Techniques

* Denormalization
* Aggregates
* Application Side Joins

#### General Modeling Techniques

* Atomic Aggregates
* Enumerable Keys
* Dimensionality Reduction
* Index Table
* Composite Key Index
* Aggregation with Composite Keys
* Inverted Search - Direct Aggregation

#### Hierarchy Modeling Techniques

* Tree Aggregation
* Adjacency Lists
* Materialized Paths
* Nested Sets
* Nested Documents Flattening: Numbered Field Names
* Nested Documents Flattening: Proximity Queries
* Batch Graph Processing
